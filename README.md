imagemanipulation
=================

Some very simple scripts and shortcode I have written that have helped save time with shipping and image manipulation. Hopefully you will find them useful. 

To use the files you will need to install ImageMagick which can be done easily using homebrew on mac via brew install imagemagick or via any other installer on whatever flavor on linux/unix you are using. Or you can download it and install from here: http://www.imagemagick.org/
